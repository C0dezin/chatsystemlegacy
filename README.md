# chatsystem(legacy)

CSL (Chat System Legacy) was a room-based chat system I created with the initial goal of learning the basics of securing a chat platform. However, it ended up as a "stupid but functional" chat. One of its quirks was that if a user made any mistake, the system would simply claim the room didn’t exist—an unconventional way to prevent brute-force attacks.

I can't say much at the moment, but I can assure you that it's coming back, and it will be much better.
